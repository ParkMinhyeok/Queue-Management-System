# swarming autonomous vehicle networks with queue management systems

In this paper, we propose an innovative priority-based queue management system for swarming autonomous vehicle networks. The system aims to improve network efficiency by optimizing the balance between server-side processing and local computing. The proposed algorithm dynamically assigns priorities and adjusts the queue in real-time based on the vehicles' ranking positions. The main features of the system include priority-based queue insertion, estimated processing time (ETA) prediction, and an adaptive processing decision mechanism. This allows for efficient processing of high-priority requests while providing local processing options for lower-priority requests.

## System Overview
The proposed queue management system is designed to handle multiple clients (vehicle) with varying priorities depending on their position in the vehicle ranks.
The system improves the efficiency of the entire network by optimizing the balance between server-side processing and local computing.

## Queue Management Algorithm
The queue management algorithm works in the following steps

### 1. Initial queue state
The server maintains a queue of processing requests from various clients (vehicles).

### 2. Priority assignment
Clients are assigned priority based on their position in the queue, with cars in
front having higher priority.

### 3. Queue insertion
When a new processing request arrives, it is inserted into the queue according
to the following rules:
* If the queue is empty, the request is placed at the front.
* If there are lower priority requests in the queue, the new request is inserted
before them.
* If there are higher priority requests in the queue, the new request is placed
after them.
### 4. Dynamic queue adjustment
As new requests arrive, the queue is constantly adjusted to ensure that high
priority clients are always served first.
### 5. ETA prediction
For each request in the queue, an estimated time to complete (ETA) is calculated.
### 6. Adaptive processing decision
Based on the calculated ETA, the system decides to either:
* Process the request on the server
* Process the request partially on the server
* Redirect the request to local processing on the client

## ETA Prediction Formula
The Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for a specific request can be calculated as:

$$
ETA_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} T_j + T_i
$$

Where:
- $ETA_i$: Predicted ETA for the \( i \)-th request.
- $T_j$: Average processing time for the \( j \)-th request ahead in the queue.
- $T_i$: Estimated processing time for the current request.
